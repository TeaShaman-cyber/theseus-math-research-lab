# Digamma #50 — evidence provenance

**Scope:** archived rational computation, not Lean-kernel acceptance.

The original local source was `/workspace/data/digamma-50`. Exactly
four files were copied into this directory. Original SHA-256:

| File | Original SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `tstar-corridor-cert.py` | `c0e345de72e31b81e947e43664319345b2b49a03239c8b326b9075974fc3e6ff` |
| `tstar-corridor-rational-certificate.json` | `b98c13ea01c08778ad1abfdfd2ffdda21a1dd44b9818385a9864f181c9da6f90` |
| `convexity-rational-cert.py` | `821e17589cf5a1c4f17c9bb7cb392048fa8ec0dc26839716dc3284739c31865e` |
| `convexity-rational-certificate.json` | `7751fb08b8152e4967b28eb04b26533d4aa1551ffdcc0b20ea18406e5394eaa7` |

**Portability change only:** the two checked-in Python files replace
the hard-coded output directory with `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`.
The original historical script hashes above refer to their pre-portability
versions. Mathematical formulas and parameters were not altered.

## Reproduce

From an isolated repository checkout with compatible Python and SymPy 1.14:

```sh
python research/digamma-symmetric-minimum/evidence/tstar-corridor-cert.py
python research/digamma-symmetric-minimum/evidence/convexity-rational-cert.py
```

Both scripts overwrite paired JSON receipts in their own directory.
For a non-destructive byte comparison, run in a disposable copy and
check the resulting SHA-256 against the JSON hashes in the table.

The rational endpoint script relies on separate accepted bounds for
Euler's constant and pi and on the pinned Zeta23 real digamma identity.
The curvature script treats positivity of the derivative denominator
as an externally established algebraic fact. Its boolean flags are
**not** Lean proof artifacts.

The actual mathematical conclusions remain governed by
[research issue #50](https://github.com/TeaShaman-cyber/theseus-math-research-lab/issues/50).
A certificate must not be promoted into a theorem merely because
the generating command exits successfully.

## Exact re-execution in MarcoPolo (2026-10-29)

Both checked-in portable scripts were rerun in a freshly created disposable
folder, without overwriting the repository copies. The generated JSON files
matched the committed historical certificate JSON **byte-for-byte**:

- `CORRIDOR_RERUN_EXACT_JSON_MATCH` — SHA-256 `b98c13ea01c08778ad1abfdfd2ffdda21a1dd44b9818385a9864f181c9da6f90`.
- `CURVATURE_RERUN_EXACT_JSON_MATCH` — SHA-256 `7751fb08b8152e4967b28eb04b26533d4aa1551ffdcc0b20ea18406e5394eaa7`.

This verifies that the recorded computations reproduce exactly in the
observed Python/SymPy runtime. **It does not constitute a Lean theorem
verification or a new proof of mathematical novelty.**

The proved proposition is only the **exact rational upper-endpoint
positivity** of the bound L(63/20), with identical 16 q terms and
tail weight to the historical certificate. It does **not** prove
the positivity of L throughout [3.14,3.15], the head/tail
inequality, the digamma differentiation lemma in Lean, or the H50
inequality itself.

The preceding attempt
[run 40888769870](https://github.com/TeaShaman-cyber/theseus-math-research-lab/actions/runs/40888769870)
failed due to three Lean noncomputable-definition diagnostics.
[PR #61](https://github.com/TeaShaman-cyber/theseus-math-research-lab/pull/61)
corrected that declaration boundary only; no mathematical formula was
changed. This history is retained to distinguish failed execution from
a mathematical counterexample.

This proves only the exact rational endpoint margin in Lean.
Manuscript Section 5.1 supplies the separate ordinary-analysis
derivative/Lipschitz and mean-value proof that the rational L(y)
stays positive throughout the entire corridor. Neither that
global proof nor H_y''(x)>=L(y) is yet formalized in Lean.

## H50-P3 four finite polynomial sign lemmas — Lean run 40907184557

- Exact upstream: `anthropics/formal-math@fbdc36bbf17d20af3fd0447c6d1a8a02773c9844`; Lean 4.33.0-rc2.

Observed: `PASS / ELABORATES`, return code 0, source-bound cache hit. The four newly accepted declarations are `H50.tiny_first_poly_pos`, `H50.small_second_poly_pos`, `H50.middle_first_poly_neg`, and `H50.tail_first_poly_pos`. All four axiom lists contain only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`. No `sorry`. The raw output has two non-blocking linter warnings for unused hypothesis names; no proof errors.

**Scope of Lean acceptance:** four bounded polynomial-sign inequalities used in the ordinary-analysis interval monotonicity/concavity argument. The differentiation of q and r, the infinite integral comparison and the complete H50 inequality are **not** yet kernel checked. The distinguished-ordinate corridor remains a separate external rational certificate obligation.
